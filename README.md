The program suit to produce a 3d tomography reconstruction from a 2d Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images.

It contains a number of sub-projects to build command-line tools to make a 3d tomography reconstruction. These programs were used in a PhD dissertation of the author: Oleg Abrosimov. The dissertation is written in the russian language and can be obtained by request for olegabr at mail.ru.

The folder `tomo-package` contains the ppt presentation `tomo_basics_and_package_plan.ppt`. It describes the way this project can be developed. It was an attempt to make a commercial software for TEM tomography, but it was not realized because of financial reasons. That is why the project is now in public domain. Feel free to use and develop/extend it for any purpose.
